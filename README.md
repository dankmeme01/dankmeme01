## Hi there 👋

I am a programmer originating from Ukraine, my main hobbies are reversing and modding games (best at x86/x64, some little knowledge about ARM and PowerPC) and writing code (mainly Rust, C++ and Python, have experience with many other languages). 

I have experience with (and like doing):
* High-level networking (HTTP servers, websockets applications, network admin stuff)
* Low-level networking (raw TCP/UDP sockets, binary serialization, NAT traversal)
* (Micro-)optimization, writing *fast* code immediately instead of optimizing later, considering every heap allocation a lost chance
* Low-level computer architecture (writing assembly, using SIMD intrinsics, debugging applications with no source code)
* Cryptography (big fan of jwt-like tokens, blake3 and XChaCha20Poly1305, many of my network projects incorporate end-to-end encryption :) )
* Complaining about the tiniest inefficiencies and formatting errors when reviewing PRs

I have also made [Globed](https://github.com/GlobedGD), a multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash and arguably the most popular mod on Geode.

Some other notable projects I've made:

* [Argon](https://github.com/GlobedGD/argon) - a modern authentication API for Geometry Dash accounts, used by many mods
* [Blaze](https://github.com/dankmeme01/blaze) - a WIP Geometry Dash optimization mod. Currently mostly optimizes game loading & saving, which in the future will expand to more
* [Arc](https://github.com/dankmeme01/arc) - a WIP C++ async runtime, aiming to be very similar to the Rust async ecosystem
* [qsox](https://github.com/dankmeme01/qsox) - a cross-platform C++ abstraction for sockets, with API similar to Rust's `std::net` module
* Qunet ([cpp](https://github.com/dankmeme01/qunet-cpp), [rust](https://github.com/dankmeme01/qunet)) - an advanced network library used by Globed, that aims to abstract away intricacies of various platforms, IPv4 vs IPv6, TCP vs UDP, compression, etc. and make it easy to write robust network clients and servers (primarily made for games).
