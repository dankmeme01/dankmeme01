## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I reverse engineer and mod games (best at x86/x64, some little knowledge about ARM and PowerPC), I program well in C++, Rust and Python, and have experience with many other languages.

I have also made [Globed](https://github.com/GlobedGD), a multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash and arguably the most popular mod on Geode.

If you want to contact me, the best place is on Discord (@dank_meme01). I don't actively use any other social media.
