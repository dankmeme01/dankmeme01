## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer originating from Ukraine, my main hobbies are reversing and modding games (best at x86/x64, some little knowledge about ARM and PowerPC) and writing code (mainly C++, Rust and Python, have experience with many other languages). 

I have experience with (and like doing):
* High-level networking (HTTP servers, websockets applications, network admin stuff)
* Low-level networking (raw TCP/UDP sockets, binary serialization, NAT traversal)
* (Micro-)optimization, writing *fast* code immediately instead of optimizing later, considering every heap allocation a lost chance
* Low-level computer architecture (writing assembly, using SIMD intrinsics, debugging applications with no source code)
* Cryptography (big fan of jwt-like tokens, blake3 and XChaCha20Poly1305, many of my network projects incorporate end-to-end encryption :) )
* Complaining about the tiniest inefficiencies and formatting errors when reviewing PRs

I have also made [Globed](https://github.com/GlobedGD), a multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash and arguably the most popular mod on Geode.

If you want to contact me, the best place is on Discord (@dank_meme01). I don't actively use any other social media.
